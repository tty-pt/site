`pi-mm` gives your [Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) long-term memory that survives context compaction and cross-session restarts.

It combines native C database speed (`libcorm`) with intelligent decision judging (Jev System One) and dense vector embeddings (`libsepal`). By default, it operates completely autonomously: it injects relevant prior memories into context before each turn and captures new knowledge when tasks settle—without requiring manual tool calls.

## How It Works in Pi

`pi-mm` hooks directly into the standard Pi extension lifecycle:

1. **Before Agent Starts (`before_agent_start`)**:  
   When you send a prompt, `pi-mm` runs a hybrid search across lexical keywords ([libstoma](https://github.com/tty-pt/site/tree/main/external/libstoma)) and vector embeddings ([libsepal](https://github.com/tty-pt/site/tree/main/external/libsepal)). Relevant memories are automatically injected into the prompt context.
2. **When the Turn Concludes (`agent_settled`)**:  
   When the agent finishes its response, `pi-mm` evaluates the exchange using an intelligent judge to decide whether to `remember`, `update`, or `skip`. Meaningful technical conclusions and learnings are cleanly summarized and persisted to disk.
3. **Agent Tools**:  
   When the agent needs to explicitly search, record, or verify memories, it has access to a focused **3-tool workflow**: `memory_recall`, `memory_record`, and `memory_review`.

## Quickstart: Pair with Local `axil-qllm` (60 Seconds)

You can pair `pi-mm` with [axil-qllm](https://github.com/tty-pt/libqllm) (or any compatible OpenAI / Jev System One endpoint) for private, zero-cost, local inference and embeddings.

> 📖 **Full axil-qllm Documentation**: See [libqllm README](https://github.com/tty-pt/libqllm) (or local [libqllm/README.md](../../../libqllm/README.md)) for installation and multi-model configuration details.

### 1. Download Fast GGUF Models (~530 MB total)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.models

# Generative Chat & System One Judge (398 MB)
curl -L -o ~/.models/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf

# Semantic Vector Embeddings (133 MB)
curl -L -o ~/.models/bge-small-en-v1.5.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/CompendiumLabs/bge-small-en-v1.5-gguf/resolve/main/bge-small-en-v1.5-q8_0.gguf
```

### 2. Start the `axil-qllm` Multi-Model Daemon

```bash
QLLM_JUDGE_MODEL="qwen" \
QLLM_JUDGE_PATH=~/.models/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct.gguf \
QLLM_CHAT_MODEL="qwen" \
QLLM_CHAT_PATH=~/.models/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct.gguf \
QLLM_EMBED_MODEL="bge-small" \
QLLM_EMBED_PATH=~/.models/bge-small-en-v1.5.gguf \
axil -A -d -p 4242 -m /home/quirinpa/libqllm/lib/libaxil-qllm
```

### 3. Enable in Pi

Add the configuration to your project's `.pi/settings.json` (or user `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "pi-mm": {
    "judgeMode": "auto",
    "judgeUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4242",
    "judgeModel": "qwen",
    "embedUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4242/v1/embeddings",
    "embedModel": "bge-small",
    "semanticSearch": true
  }
}
```

Start Pi and test it:
```bash
pi
```
When you talk to Pi, `pi-mm` will automatically classify technical decisions with Qwen and generate 384-dimensional dense vectors with BGE for instant semantic recall in future sessions!

## Installation & Setup

`pi-mm` can be installed like any standard Pi extension:

### Project-Specific (Recommended for Repositories)
Place or clone the extension into your repository's `.pi/extensions/` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tty-pt/site .pi/extensions/pi-mm
```

### Global User Extension
Place or clone the extension into your global Pi agent directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tty-pt/site ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-mm
```

### Direct CLI Flag
Run directly during development:
```bash
pi --extension .pi/extensions/pi-mm
```

## Configuration Reference

## Agent Tools (The Essential 3)

By default, `pi-mm` exposes only 3 high-level tools to keep the model's context window clean and avoid tool ambiguity:

### 1. `memory_recall`
Performs hybrid search fusing keyword matches ([libstoma](https://github.com/tty-pt/site/tree/main/external/libstoma)) and vector similarity ([libsepal](https://github.com/tty-pt/site/tree/main/external/libsepal)) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion ($k=60$).
- **`query`**: Natural-language question, topic, error message, or symbol.
- **`project`** / **`subsystem`**: Optional scope filters to boost matching memories.
- **`includeEvidence`**: When `true`, automatically fetches and attaches the full underlying evidence tree (diffs, shell commands, prior investigations).

### 2. `memory_record`
Explicitly records a resolved task, bug fix, or project invariant.
- **`problem`**: Description of what was addressed or investigated.
- **`approaches`**: List of attempted solutions with outcome (`"worked"`, `"failed"`, or `"abandoned"`) and reason.
- **`diffs`**: Associated git diffs, file edits, or terminal commands.
- **`evidence`**: Supporting memory reference IDs.
- **`verification`**: Verified test commands (`testsPassed: string[]`).

### 3. `memory_review`
Reviews memory hierarchies and manages factual confidence.
- **`action: "inspect"`**: Returns full episode details, approaches, and downward evidence trees.
- **`action: "update_lifecycle"`**: Updates confidence lifecycle (`tested`, `supported`, `contradicted`, `superseded`) with required justification and evidence validation.

## Design Guarantees: Private, Resilient, & Offline-First

* **Zero Lock-In & Offline-First**: Lexical search, temporal indexing, and storage run entirely locally in compiled C (`libcorm`). No cloud account or external connection is required.
* **Graceful Degradation**: If your LLM daemon is offline or restarting, `pi-mm` never crashes Pi. It marks `degraded: true` and falls back to deterministic local sentence heuristics.
* **Strict Directive Precedence**: When a user explicitly says *"remember this: ..."* or *"forget that"*, `pi-mm` immediately honors the command, bypassing LLM judge evaluation.
* **Epistemic Safety**: Memories cannot be arbitrarily marked as verified facts without proof. Automated records remain `tested` until backed by valid test execution evidence.
